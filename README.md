# Options Info 
## what is this
this is a pretty simple excel plugin that I wrote in python to get better at python and help out a friend.
it definitely needs some optimization, commenting, etc, but its a solid start and it's pretty functional.
I think that having it output one value at a time will make it work in a table, but we'll see.
if you have any questions feel free to email me!

## INSTALLATION
You'll need all of the .py files in the same directory as your excel spreadsheet file.
In addition, your workbook needs to be saved as a macro enabled workbook, so make sure you do that through excel by using "**Save as**" and selecting "**Macro Enabled Workbook**", the extension should be **.xlsm**
Now, you'll need to make sure that python is installed, and I'd recommend creating a venv using a terminal.
