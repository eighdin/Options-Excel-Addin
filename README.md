# Options Info 
## what is this
this is a pretty simple excel plugin that I wrote in python to get better at python and help out a friend.
it definitely needs some optimization, commenting, etc, but its a solid start and it's pretty functional.
I think that having it output one value at a time will make it work in a table, but we'll see.
if you have any questions feel free to email me!
